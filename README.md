## Requirements
1) Numpy
2) OpenCV
3) scipy.stats

## A) Image Denoising via Gibbs Sampling
run using 'python a1/gibbs_denoising.py'

results obtained at each iteration will be stored in folder 'a1/gibbs_denoising_results/' as <image_number>_denoise_<iteration_number>.txt and .jpg

## B) Image Denoising via Variational Inference
run using 'python a1/variational_inference_denoising.py'

results obtained at each iteration will be stored in folder 'a1/variational_inference_denoising_results/' as <image_number>_denoise_<iteration_number>.txt and .jpg

## C) Image Segmentation using EM algorithm
run using 'python a2/em_segmentation.py' 

results will be stored in folder 'a2/results/' as <animal>_mask.txt, <animal>_background.txt, <animal>_foreground.txt as well as .jpg files.
